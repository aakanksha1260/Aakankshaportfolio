            <h4>I-FARMING WEBSITE </h4>
            <p>We built this website with farmers in mind. The user of this website can easily learn about farming with its assistance. With the aid of html, css, and javscript, we created this website, and the database we used was mysql. This website provides the most useful information on farming, including weather forecasts that make it simple for farmers to learn about the weather and decide what crops to plant during specific seasons.

Dejango will be used to create this website using HTML, CSS, and Python.
